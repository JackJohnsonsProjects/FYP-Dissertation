Final Year Project report for my digital booklet for antimicrobial resistances. The booklet was aimed towards teenagers and the aim was to teach them about bacteria spread using augmented reality to create playful visualizations.

I decided to create a digital booklet as a separate application from the augmented reality application. The idea is that the user could use their phone to augment videos and images on different pages of the booklet as they flip through the pages.
